# Introduction
# Background

This tool was built by David Guetta to educate and democratize predictive analytics. This tool makes the algorithms that are the foundation to artificial intelligence accessible to anyone for free. The most advanced AI algorithms are built using artificial neural network and have the strongest predictive power, but they require teams of PhDs to design and maintain. The algorithms in this tool provide ~95% of the predictive power of a neural network with ~10% of the work.

 This excel add-in makes it easy to run causal and predictive analytics like linear/logistic regressions, boosted decision trees, random forests and text analytics using tools like K-fold cross validation, lasso penalties, TF-IDF weights and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. A working understanding of all of these approaches and tools is assumed, but links are included for reference.

 The general steps to using this tool are:

1. Select data
2. Specify model and parameters
3. Evaluate outputs

## Use Cases

A major difficulty of predictive analytics is understanding the use cases; this tool can be used to:

### Health
Anticipate a cardiac arrest using wearable device data or help a Radiologist review more X-rays with greater accuracy.

### Banking
Better anticipate a borrower's chances of defaulting on a loan or paying off a credit card with a combination of public and underwriting information.

### Environment
Predict the amount of carbon dioxide that a farm has removed from the atmosphere using operation data such as crops planted, irrigation, amount of fertilizer.

### Retail
Let shoppers try on clothes, shoes and furniture with just a picture.

### Sports
Chose the optimal play based on the opponent's historic play calling and field position.

### Logistics
Design the optimal route of delivery based on inventory and customer local.

### Marketing
Autonomously review customer feedback to identify positive, negative and even fake reviews.
